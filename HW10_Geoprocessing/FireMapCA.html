    <h4> I have focused recently on the fires taking place in California, previously I have looked at the subject using air quality as a metric, this time I used the number of confirmed reports as the metric for fire frequency and severity due to both being correlated with the number of reports from what I have seen. The first operation that I performed was to clip the point layer data which represented the individual points accross the entire US because I was only interested in those occuring in CA. Afterwards, I performed an intersection on the remaining points to see which reports were affiliated with witch counties in order to scale the counties according to the number of reports. I did not think that a scale was particularly useful in this case because the raw number of reports was added for each county making it easy to understand the scale being used.
