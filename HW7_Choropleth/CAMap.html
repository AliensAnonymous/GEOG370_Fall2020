    <h4>I chose to focus on the unemplyoment rate from the past few years in California given that it is a metric which is often thrown about.
        California is both the classic 'land of opportunity' if you can get a good job in growing technology fields, but I was curious about how many jobs there are actually were to be had and how many were in a sense being left behind.
        It turned out that it is much as you would expect, there is low unemplyment is the wealthier areas which are often by the coast and centered around San Francisco and Silicon Valley, while the agricultural areas appear to have higher unemployment rates.
