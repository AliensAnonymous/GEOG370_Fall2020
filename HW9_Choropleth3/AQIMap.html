    <h4>I looked at the Median AQI values for the counties where I could find data because California has had no shortage of forest fires recently which are contributuing to horrible air quality for many. Sadly the data I found was only accurate through April for 2020 and so do not include some of the most severe forest fires which have occurred so far this year.

    <h4>I included both 2020 and 2019 because there is much less available data for 2020 as of now.
